## 📌 About This Document

This document is written as a **first introduction to programming** for people who have never written a single line of code.  
It is meant as a **clear and accessible starting point**, without complex technical terms.

⚠️ **Note:**  
I have dyslexia. That means some phrases may sound different or be written in a slightly unconventional way.  
But the content has been carefully reviewed and is **100% accurate**. It’s built to be logical and understandable – especially if you’re completely new to coding. Questions are always welcome!

## 🌱 Start at the Beginning

### 🔹 No-Code Platforms
Create workflows or tools visually, without writing code.

**Examples:**  
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)  
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com), [n8n](https://n8n.io), [Retool](https://retool.com)

---

### 🔹 Databases
Think of this as smarter Excel – a way to store and organize data.

**Languages & Systems:**  
- SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- Airtable (low-code), MongoDB

---

### 🔹 Scripting Languages
Your first step into real coding.

**Examples:**  
- Python, JavaScript, PHP, BASIC  
- HTML and CSS are supporting languages often used in websites

---

### 🔹 High-Level Languages
Used to build apps and complex software.

**Examples:**  
- Java, C#, C++, Delphi

---

### 🔹 Assembler & Machine Code
Very close to the hardware. Not needed for beginners, but good to know it exists.

---

## 🌐 REST APIs & Webhooks

- **REST API:** Let programs talk to each other via the internet.
- **Webhook:** React to events automatically.

Tools like [n8n](https://n8n.io) let you build these visually.

## 📘 Suggested Learning Path

1. Start with no-code tools
2. Learn about databases and SQL
3. Practice with scripting languages
4. Explore high-level programming languages
5. (Optional) Learn assembler if you're curious about how computers work inside

## 📏 Rules and Tips for Beginners

📌 These are my personal style rules – they help me stay organized and avoid mistakes. Take what works for you!

### 🔹 Rules

- **It’s true until it’s no longer true**  
- **It’s not true until proven true**  
- **Do one thing at a time**  
- **Break things into small parts** – easier to reuse and fix later  
- **Use clear names** for variables and functions  
- **Write comments in your code** – even for your future self  
- **Make things reusable** – don’t tie everything directly to GUI or database

---

### 🔹 Terminology

- **GUI:** Graphical User Interface (buttons, screens, menus)
- **Database:** A structured way to store and retrieve data
- **Variable:** Stores values like text or numbers inside a program
- **Function:** A piece of code that does something and returns a result
- **Procedure:** A piece of code that does something but does not return a value
- **NOOB:** Slang for a beginner – and that’s totally fine!

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- **Google** is your best friend  
  Search like this: `language name + what you want to do`

- **ChatGPT** can help you understand and learn

- Avoid some forums like StackExchange – they’re not always friendly to beginners

**Recommended Tools:**
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
