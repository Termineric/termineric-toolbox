# 🧰 Termineric Toolbox

**Termineric Toolbox** is a personal collection of open-source tools, scripts, and helpers that I’ve created or am actively developing. These tools are built to support various workflows — including Laravel-based development, data conversion, and automation tasks — and are designed to be modular, flexible, and easy to reuse.

## 🛠️ Areas of Focus

The Termineric Toolbox contains utilities and helpers across multiple domains:

### 🔹 Laravel
- Migration and seeding automation
- Legacy database import helpers
- Console commands and artisan shortcuts

### 🔹 Delphi (VCL / FMX)
- Component cleanup and debugging helpers
- Project scaffolding and code generation
- Integration scripts (e.g. REST/JSON clients)

### 🔹 MySQL / MariaDB
- Table introspection and conversion tools
- Schema cleaning and formatting
- Backup and test-data management utilities

### 🔹 CLI / Automation
- Script-based workflows (batch/PHP)
- Helper scripts for setup, import/export
- Logging and consistency checks

### 🔹 MCU / PIC Development
- Logic and bus testing tools
- Serial communication scripts (e.g. UART monitoring)
- Development utilities for working with microcontrollers and debugging circuits

### 🔹 6502 Retro / Hardware Projects
- Address and data bus debugging tools
- ROM/EPROM content generation
- Instruction testing, signal tracing and logic validation
- Utilities for homebrew 6502-based systems

### 🔹 Windows Installers & Tools
- Setup scripts and custom installers for Windows-based tools
- Delphi app packaging and system helpers

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Not everything is available in this repository yet — I’m currently reviewing and cleaning up old tools before publishing them.  
Some scripts are being tested to make sure they still work correctly on modern systems.

## 🙌 I hope you find something useful in this collection.

Groeten,
