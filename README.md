# 🧰 Termineric Toolbox

**Termineric Toolbox** is a personal collection of open-source tools, scripts, and helpers that I’ve created or am actively developing. These tools are built to support various workflows — including Laravel-based development, data conversion, and automation tasks — and are designed to be modular, flexible, and easy to reuse.

## 🛠️ Areas of Focus

The Termineric Toolbox contains utilities and helpers across multiple domains:

### 🔹 Laravel
- Migration and seeding automation
- Legacy database import helpers
- Console commands and artisan shortcuts

### 🔹 Delphi (VCL / FMX)
- Component cleanup and debugging helpers
- Project scaffolding and code generation
- Integration scripts (e.g. REST/JSON clients)

### 🔹 MySQL / MariaDB
- Table introspection and conversion tools
- Schema cleaning and formatting
- Backup and test-data management utilities

### 🔹 CLI / Automation
- Script-based workflows (batch/PHP)
- Helper scripts for setup, import/export
- Logging and consistency checks

### 🔹 Windows App Installers
- Standalone Windows applications I’ve written in the past
- Provided with installers for convenience
- Built for and tested on Windows only
- Source code is not included
- Shared as-is, without guarantees or support

### 🔹 TechnoCave (Hobby Projects)

Tools and experiments from my personal electronics lab, **TechnoCave** — focused on microcontrollers, retro hardware and circuit design.

- **MCU / PIC Development**  
  Logic and bus testing tools, UART communication scripts, and low-level development utilities.

- **6502 Retro ASM**  
  Address/data bus debugging, ROM content generation, signal tracing, and instruction validation for 6502-based systems.

- **Hardware Projects**  
  Prototyping helpers, power/signal monitoring tools, and general electronics utilities.

- **Lab Tools & Experiments**  
  Blinking light boards, testing rigs, and experimental circuits from ongoing projects.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Not everything is available in this repository yet — I’m currently reviewing and cleaning up older tools before publishing them.

Most of these tools are written and tested on **Windows**.  
I don’t currently have access to other operating systems, so unless otherwise noted, cross-platform compatibility is not guaranteed.  
If I test a tool on another OS or know it works, I’ll mark it clearly.

Some scripts are being reviewed to ensure they still function correctly on modern systems.

## 🙌 I hope you find something useful in this collection.

Groeten,  
**TerminEric**
